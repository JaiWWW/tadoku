This is the first time I've had to remove people and edit logs manually in order to keep things fair for everyone. Don't dump a weeks worth of reading all at once, that kind of behavior is not healthy for the contest. Especially if you're a fast reader you should be logging your pages frequently. Updates of 1000+ pages after days/weeks of silence is demotivating for other participants. From here on out I'll be removing those who dump massive updates infrequently. </p> <p>Thank you all for participating!</p>",
