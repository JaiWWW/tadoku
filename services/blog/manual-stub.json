During this time you can sign up for the round with a maximum of three languages. Submitting pages won't be possible until the round starts.</p><h2 id=\"submitting-pages\">Submitting pages</h2><p>You can submit pages once the contest has started. The contest runs based on UTC time. You can submit pages that you've read within the contest timeframe, after the contest has ended you won't be ale to add, delete, or change pages anymore.</p><h3 d=\"frequency-of-submitting-updates\">Frequency of submitting updates</h3><p>You should be posting updates in regular intervals, preferably daily. Submitting everything you've read at the end of the contest isn't in line with the spirit of the contest. Tadoku is supposed to motivate people to read more, and in order to keep things fair updates should be somewhat regular. Participants who keep posting irregular (large) updates will be removed from the contest. Repeat offenders may be banned from future rounds.</p><h3 id=\"submitting-re-reads-repeats-\">Submitting re-reads (repeats)</h3><p>If you have previously read something during the same round, but would still like to read it again for the contest you can do so.  Cut the total amount of pages you've read in half and submit them as-is. As much as possible I would like to discourage re-reading the same material, but I also understand that sometimes it makes sense to do so.</p><h2 id=\"media\">Media</h2><p>You can read various types of media for the Tadoku contest. Each medium has a different points (points = Tadoku pages) per page value associated with it.  The following list will show you the available media and points per page values.</p><ul><li>Book: <strong>1</strong> point per page</li><li>Manga: <strong>0.2</strong> points per page</li><li>Net: <strong>1</strong> points per page</li><li>Full game: <strong>0.1667</strong> points per screen (for games which use nearly the whole screen as a text box, such as Fate/Stay Night)</li><li>Game:  <strong>0.05</strong> points per screen</li><li>News: <strong>1</strong> point per page</li><li>Sentences: <strong>0.05</strong> points per sentence, this value might change per language in the future</li></ul><p>If you are able to manually count characters yourself, you are free to use that value instead of the approximates listed. Divide the characters by the amount that makes sense for the category, such as <strong>400</strong> for Book or <strong>20</strong> for Game.</p><h3 id=\"ebooks\">Ebooks</h3><p>Tracking pages read of ebooks can be quite tricky. Most of the times they are counted in sections, and every book will be different depending on the device/software you're using. Here is one way to calculate your page count using the book <strong>こころ</strong> (Kokoro) by Natsume Soseki:</p><ol><li>Get the total page count from the paper copy, a total of <strong>384</strong> pages according to Amazon Japan</li><li>The kindle shows me there are a total of <strong>4513</strong> locations in this book. This means that 1 page from the paper copy is equal to <strong>11.75</strong> locations in the ebook.</li><li>Let's say I've read from location <strong>400</strong> to <strong>640</strong>, <strong>+240</strong> locations since tracking last time. <strong>240 / 11.75 = 20.425531915</strong></li><li>I usually round down/up the number when tracking, and correct the discrepancy when I finish the book. In this case I'd track this as <strong>20.4</strong> book pages read.</li></ol>",
