Submitting everything you've read at the end of the contest isn't in line with the spirit of the contest. Tadoku is supposed to motivate people to read more, and in order to keep things fair updates should be somewhat regular. Participants who keep posting irregular (large) updates will be removed from the contest. Repeat offenders may be banned from future rounds.</blockquote><p>This won't be applied retroactively, but it will be enforced starting next round.</p>",
